# Generate_TV_Scripts
Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Project #3.

* This repo is about how to generate your own TV Scripts using Recurrent Neural Networks.
* It is implemented by using PyTorch library.
* You can refer to Original Udacity repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation)
Objective: Generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. The input data was Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

# Generate_TV_Scripts
Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Project #3.

* This repo is about how to generate your own TV Scripts using Recurrent Neural Networks.
* It is implemented by using PyTorch library.
* You can refer to Original Udacity repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation)

# Project Synopsis

Writing scripts for a TV program is a mundane task.Imagine writing every word which come out from every character in a movie or a tv drama to get a complete script.Instead of writing manually,here we are trying a build Long Short Term Memory Networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – which are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. In this case, I used Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) implemented in PyTorch.

* What is

Language is in many ways the seed in intelligence. We as humans use language to convey informations between each other.But unfortunately, computers can't really understand human languages. New breatktrough in AI has led to more technolgies in language understanding called Natural Language Processing (NLP).


Objective: Generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. The input data was Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

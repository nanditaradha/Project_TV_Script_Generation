# Generate_TV_Scripts
Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Project #3.

* This repo is about how to generate your own TV Scripts using Recurrent Neural Networks.
* It is implemented by using PyTorch library.
* You can refer to Original Udacity repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation)

# Project Synopsis

Writing scripts for a TV program is a mundane task.Imagine writing every word which comes out from every character in a movie or a tv drama inorder to generate a complete script.Instead of writing manually,here we are going to generate a TV script using Long Short Term Memory Networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – which are a special kind of RNN,capable of learning long-term dependencies.We will train these networks by feeding them an existing TV script. Once the networks are trained we will generate a new TV script. As These networks are capable of predicting and generating the next words that we are intended to generate sequentially in the script.In this case,I used Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) implemented in PyTorch.

In this project, we are going to generate a TV script using LSTM Network. We will train these networks by feeding them an existing TV script. Once the networks are trained we will generate a new TV script.s



Language is in many ways the seed in intelligence. We as humans use language to convey informations between each other. But unfortunately, computers can't really understand human languages. New breatktrough in AI has led to more technolgies in language understanding called Natural Language Processing (NLP).

# Natural Language Processing

NLP is the study that focuses on the interactions between human language and computers. By using NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.


Objective: Generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. The input data was Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
